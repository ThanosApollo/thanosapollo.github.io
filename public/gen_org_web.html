<li>It is often used for keeping notes, maintaining TODO lists, planning projects, and authoring documents with a fast and effective plain-text system./</li>
</ul>

If you are already is required to do a lot of note-taking/text-editing, using org-mode and emacs to create your content is probably the best option, especially if you are planning on sharing them with your colleagues in different formats. Org-mode is a versatile tool that can be used to generate static websites because it provides a number of features that make it well-suited for this task:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>One of the main reasons I'm <b>personally</b> using org-mode, is due to my love of emacs(which I should make a different blog post about) and the ability to create my notes as an org file, and then export it in various formats and share it with my colleagues.</li>
<li>org-mode is an <i>outline-based editor</i>, which makes it easy to organize and structure the content of a website. This allows users to quickly create and edit the headings, subheadings, and sections of a website, and to organize the content in a hierarchical fashion.</li>
<li>org-mode provides <b>built-in support for rich text formatting</b>, which allows users to easily format the text, images, and other elements of a website. This includes support for headings, lists, tables, and links, as well as the ability to apply custom styles and formatting.</li>
<li>org-mode provides a number of export options, which allows users to convert their org-mode files into a variety of formats, such as HTML, LaTeX, and PDF. This makes it easy to generate a static website, since org-mode can be used to create the content and structure of the site, and then export it to HTML.</li>
<li>org-mode provides the ability to embed source code and results, which make it well-suited to generate websites with dynamic contents. This can be useful to include interactive elements in the website or to build a website using a static site generator that is embedded in org-mode file.</li>
<li>org-mode's extensibility and popularity make it easy to find tools and resources for generating websites with org-mode. There are many packages and tutorials available for creating and publishing websites with org-mode.</li>
</ul>

<p>
In summary, org-mode is a great tool for creating static websites because of its powerful outlining capabilities, rich formatting options, and the ease of exporting to multiple formats, including HTML.

<p>
There are several ways to create a website with org-mode, but one of the most popular ways is to use the built-in export functionality to convert org-mode files into HTML files, which can then be served as a static website. Here are the general steps to create a website with org-mode:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>Install and configure emacs and org-mode</b>: In order to use org-mode, you will need to have the emacs text editor installed on your computer. You can then install the org-mode package, which will provide the necessary functionality for creating and exporting org-mode files. To better understand emacs I recommend watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74zOY-vgkyw&amp;list=PLEoMzSkcN8oPH1au7H6B7bBJ4ZO7BXjSZ">Emacs From Scratch</a> series from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@SystemCrafters">SystemCrafters</a> youtube channel.</li>
<li>Create an org-mode file: Use emacs to create a new file and save it with the .org file extension. This file will contain the content and structure of your website.</li>
<li>Add content and structure to your org-mode file: Use org-mode's outlining and formatting features to create the headings, subheadings, and sections of your website, and to add text, images, and other elements.</li>
<li>Export your org-mode file to HTML: Once you have added content and structure to your org-mode file, you can use org-mode's built-in export functionality to convert it to an HTML file. You can either export the whole file or specific parts of it.</li>
<li>Publish your website: After exporting the org-mode file to HTML, you can use a web server or a static site hosting service to serve the HTML files such as Codeberg or Github.</li>
</ul>

I prefer creating my websites using my own <a href="https://codeberg.org/ThanosApollo/org-web-themes">org-web-themes</a> <i>a fork of <a href="https://github.com/fniessen/org-html-themes">org-html-themes</a></i>
