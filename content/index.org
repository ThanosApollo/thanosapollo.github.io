Hey there! My name is Thanos Apollo, a Greek medical student currently studying at the Medical University of Sofia. I've always had a love for medicine and technology, and that's why I am interested in the free and open-source movement and GNU/Linux.
 I want to learn as much as I can about the benefits and potential of free and open-source software in healthcare and medicine, and how they can be utilized to improve the field. I believe that with my background in medicine and passion for open-source, I can make a real difference in the field of healthcare technology.
 My goal is to continuously progress in my knowledge and expertise in the field and hope that my contributions will make a real difference in the future.
