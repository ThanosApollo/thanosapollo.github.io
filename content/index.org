** Generating static websites with org-mode
/I'm using this personal website to learn how to automate the process of building a website using org-mode./

Currently I'm using [[https://github.com/fniessen/org-html-themes][org-html-themes]] with modified css, styled using dracula theme palette, along with a build script inspired by the [[https://github.com/SystemCrafters/wiki-site][system crafters wiki]]. My goal is to improve this format, and use it to make a wiki page for my university, hosting our notes/documentation of our medical subjects, similarly to the way I do in the *Medicine* section, for this purpose I'll try to keep this format/styling as simple as possible.


* Projects
** MUS-Wiki
MUS-Wiki is a web project I've created similar to this website, aimed *to host notes relating to medical subjects based on Medical University of Sofia syllabus* as well as relative useful information.

The project is meant to create a website based on .org files, along with custom themes using javascript and css. The process should be simple, and easy for my colleagues to use.

/Project is under development, hosted on [[https://codeberg.org/mus-wiki/pages][codeberg]], check the project's [[https://mus-wiki.codeberg.page/public/][website]]/


** MUS-Robot
A simple telegram bot that provides the contact information of MUS departments.
